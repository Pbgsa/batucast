# Setup project

We'll use the Yarn package manager to run this project. You'll need Node.js.

Start by enabling Corepack, if it isn't already; this will add the yarn binary to your PATH:

```bash
corepack enable
```

Install the packages

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the app in dev mode

```bash
yarn dev
```

# Configure .env
